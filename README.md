This Cannabis decriminalization and optimization of industry bill is offered freely to the public to make use of.

I suggest doing the following things:
------------------------------------------
 1. Read the bill
 2. Determine if the bill fits your area's needs
 3. Make any necessary adjustments
 4. Present the bill to locals and gauge their take on the bill as it is, garner support
 5. Revisit step 3 and 4 if necessary
 6. Present the bill to local governments in emails, town halls, and physical mail-in letters.

Why I made this bill free to use:
-----------------------------------------
Plain and simple, everyone deserves access to clean products that have the regulation and safety nets to protect the public, while also addressing common concerns from the public.
